# JetGenie

JetGenie is a smart travel planning web application designed to help you plan your trips from start to finish with ease.

## ‚ú® Inspiration
Afsana and Tasmia have been friends since high school and have always dreamed of traveling the world together! We're heading to Chicago in April, and as one does when traveling, we must see everything the city has to offer. We met Eric at a hackathon, and he is also eager to jet-set the world on his own! Instead of struggling to find places, food, and shows, we created JetGenie to take care of our travel itinerary for you.

## üí° What It Does
JetGenie plans out a trip from start to finish based on your budget and trip vibes (solo, friends, family). It asks you to weigh out what activities are most important to you through a short quiz, then plans out each day of your trip, recommending morning, afternoon, and night activities. You can directly add these activities to your Google Calendar! JetGenie also includes a page where you can find hotels and accommodations nearby.
